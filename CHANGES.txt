Changelog
=========

1.0b1 - 2010-05-05
------------------

Note: 1.0b1 changes the syntax for the table-building section of the report
(previously the report column labels and expressions) and the report body. The
upgrade step overwrites these properties for the default reports that ship with
the product. If you have customized these properties on the default reports, be
sure to rename the customized reports in portal_analytics before running the
upgrade step to avoid losing your changes.
